        <h2 class="text-2xl">Changes to Terms of Use</h2><br>


        We reserve the right to change, alter, replace or otherwise modify these Terms of Use at any time, for
        example to
        address legal or regulatory changes or changes to features or functionality made available through the
        Platform, in our
        discretion. The date of last modification is stated at the end of these Terms of Use. It is your

        this page from time to time for updates.
        <br><br>
        When we make any material changes to these Terms of Use, we will provide you with prominent notice under the
        circumstances, including for example displaying a notice within the Platform and/or by sending you an email
        to the email

        become
        effective two (2) weeks after such notification.
        <br><br>
        You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do
        not terminate
        your account as described in the Termination section below during such two (2) week period, your continued
        use of the
        Platform after the end of that two (2) week period will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Description of the Platform</h2><br>


        The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and learn from
        the Shyam
        karaoke community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content that inerests you most. For
        example,
        users who upload content to Swaralaya will gain access to our creator stats feature, which provides creators
        with
        insights into how the content they upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and
        downloaders of
        such content.
        <br><br>
        Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain Service (see
        Subscriptions and Gift Codes below). Swaralaya however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe
        to such
        Services. In order to make the Platform available for free and provide you with personally relevant
        features, we serve
        tailored ads on the Platform on behalf of third party advertisers. To that end, we use information that you

        you with a
        customized experience. More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in our
        Privacy
        Policy.
        <br><br>
        We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Application, release new versions of our
        Apps, or
        introduce other services and/or features for the Platform. Any new services and features will be subject to
        these Terms
        of Use as well as any additional terms and conditions that we may release for those specific services or
        features.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Your Swaralaya account</h2><br>


        You are not obliged to register to use the Platform. However, access to the Apps and certain Services is
        only available
        to registered users. As an example, our App, Swaralaya Pulse, enables registered users, who upload and make
        available their Content to other users, to receive instant feedback on the performance of their tracks,
        communicate with
        their listeners, and manage their Content anytime.
        <br><br>

        your
        listening habits.

        username and
        password for your account. You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid.

        address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our

        <br><br>
        You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password,
        and you will
        remain responsible for all use of your username and password, and all activity emanating from your account,
        whether or
        not such activity was authorized by you.

        used,
        disclosed and otherwise processed by Shyam Karaoke in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In addition, in
        common with
        most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can

        Policy.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Meetups</h2><br>


        Shyam Karaoke has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at
        venues all over
        the world (“Meetups”). While Shyam Karaoke is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded
        promotional
        materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, Shyam Karaoke does not sponsor, oversee or in any way
        control such
        Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely
        at your own
        risk and Shyam Karaoke does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any Shyam Karaoke
        users or any
        third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Competitions and Promotions</h2><br>


        From time to time, some Shyam Karaoke users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other
        similar
        opportunities on the Platform (“Third Party Competitions”). Shyam Karaoke is not the sponsor or promoter of
        these Third
        Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any
        third parties
        who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these Third Party Competitions. If
        you wish to
        participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and
        conditions
        applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any
        eligibility
        requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of
        residence.

        If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you
        comply with our
        Competition Terms, which are available here.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Use of Shyam Karaoke players and widgets</h2><br>


        The Platform includes access to customizable players (“Players”), and an embeddable version of the
        Shyam Karaoke waveform
        player (“Widget”) for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles,
        whether or not a
        Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish,
        and to
        enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the
        Uploader.

        You may not, without the prior written consent of Shyam Karaoke, use the Players or the Widget in such a way
        that you
        aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering
        of the
        Application, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part.
        Similarly, you may
        not, without the prior written consent of Shyam Karaoke, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into
        any Application
        or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and
        you are the
        person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a
        particular
        genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that Shyam Karaoke or any artist,
        audio
        creator or
        other third party endorses or supports your Application, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing
        shall apply
        whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.

        Shyam Karaoke reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any
        reason in its
        sole discretion.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Subscription & gift codes</h2><br>


        Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a “Pro” or “Pro
        Unlimited” plan
        (together, “Pro Accounts”) or to Shyam Karaoke Go (Pro Accounts and Shyam Karaoke Go are each referred to as
        a
        “Subscrpition”).

        The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes related to Pro Accounts is subject to additional terms, which
        you will find
        here. In addition, the purchase of subscriptions for Shyam Karaoke Go is subject to additional terms, which
        you will find
        here.

        The Pro Account Terms and the Shyam Karaoke Go Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to
        payment, the
        conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your right of cancellation during the
        first 14 days
        of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.

        The Pro Account Terms are applicable to Pro and Pro Unlimited Account users and the Shyam Karaoke Go Terms
        are applicable
        to Shyam Karaoke Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription.
        Shyam Karaoke
        reserves the right to limit the availability of Shyam Karaoke Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as
        may be
        determined by Shyam Karaoke in its sole discretion from time to time.

        Changes to the Platform, accounts and pricing

        Shyam Karaoke reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease
        providing
        access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with
        respect to
        individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation,
        termination or
        cessation of access, Shyam Karaoke shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such
        decision in
        advance.

        You hereby agree that Shyam Karaoke and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees,
        agents,
        directors,
        officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications
        to the
        Application, Apps and/or any Services that Shyam Karaoke may wish to make from time to time, or for any
        decision to suspend,
        discontinue or terminate the Application, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to
        use or access
        the same from or within any territory or territories.

        Shyam Karaoke may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features,
        products or
        types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its
        Subscriptions from
        time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any
        Subscription which
        you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any
        subsequent
        renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where Shyam Karaoke proposes to make changes to any type
        of
        Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, Shyam Karaoke will
        notify you
        of the proposed changes by sending a message to your Shyam Karaoke account and/or an email to the then
        current email
        address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to
        continue using
        the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the
        Termination
        section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six
        (6) week
        period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Termination</h2><br>


        You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice in writing to help@shyamkaraoke.com,
        Germany
        confirming such termination, by removing all of Your Content from your account, or by deleting your account
        and
        thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a Subscription, and terminate this Agreement before
        the end of
        such Subscription, we are unable to offer any refund for any unexpired period of your Subscription.

        Shyam Karaoke may suspend your access to the Platform and/or terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you
        are deemed
        to be a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of any of the material provision of
        these Terms of
        Use or our Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the provisions of the following sections:
        Your Use of the
        Platform, Your Content, Grant of Licence , and Your Representations and Warranties; (iii) Shyam Karaoke
        elects at its
        discretion to cease providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you
        are
        attempting to access the Platform, or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by Shyam Karaoke
        at its
        discretion. If you have a Subscription and your account is suspended or terminated by Shyam Karaoke pursuant
        to (i) or
        (ii) above, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of your subscription. If your
        account is
        terminated pursuant to (iii) or (iv), refunds may be payable at the reasonable discretion of Shyam Karaoke.

        Once your account has been terminated, any and all Content residing in your account, or pertaining to
        activity from your
        account (for example, data relating to the distribution or consumption of your sounds), will be
        irretrievably deleted by
        Shyam Karaoke, except to the extent that we are obliged or permitted to retain such content, data or
        information for a
        certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or to protect our legitimate
        business
        interests. You are advised to save or back up any material that you have uploaded to your account before
        terminating
        your account, as Shyam Karaoke assumes no liability for any material that is irretrievably deleted following
        any
        termination of your account. Shyam Karaoke is not able to provide you with any .csv or other similar file of
        data
        relating to activity associated with your account, whether before or after termination or cancellation. This
        data is
        provided and is accessible only for viewing via your account page on the Application for as long as your
        account is active.

        If you access the Platform via any of our Apps or via any third party app connected to your account,
        deleting that app
        will not delete your account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account
        page within
        your Settings on the Application. The provisions of these Terms of Use that are intended by their nature to
        survive the
        termination or cancellation of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but
        not limited
        to, those Sections entitled Your Shyam Karaoke Account, Your Content, Grant of License , Representations and
        Warranties,
        Liability for Content, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Termination and Right of
        Cancellation,
        Assignment to Third Parties, Severability, Entire Agreement, and Applicable Law and Jurisdiction,
        respectively.

        whole or in
        part, to any third party at any time without notice, including without limitation, to any person or entity
        acquiring all
        or substantially all of the assets or business of Shyam Karaoke. You may not assign this Agreement or the

        of the
        Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect.

        <br><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl">Entire agreement</h2><br>
